# Congressional Remarks

A script I wrote for another project to collect Congressional Remarks.

## Usage
` node index.js [session(s)]`

- node index.js 117 - Single Session 
- node index.js 115,116,117 - Multiple Sessions


## Flags

`--with-front` - Launch Puppeteer with headless mode disabled

`--restart` - Starts the data collection from the beginning, instead of continuing from last run
